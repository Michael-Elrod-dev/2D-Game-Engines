# 2D Game Engine Showcase

This repository features two distinct 2D game engine projects, demonstrating implementations in C++ and Python. These projects showcase different approaches to game development, providing valuable insights for developers interested in building their own game engines.

## Projects Overview

### 1. C++ 2D Game Engine

A robust 2D game engine built with C++, SDL2, and Lua.

- **Technologies**: C++ 17, SDL2 2.0.16, Lua 5.4.4
- **Key Features**:
  - Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
  - Lua scripting for game logic
  - Asset management system
  - Event-driven communication
  - Various game components (Animation, Collision, Camera, etc.)
